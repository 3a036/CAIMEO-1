 # BADTOUCH

/*
Reconnaissance tool scans the targets before the attack is launched, and later attaches a detailed report on the target.

The tool collects its info using legitimate SMB messages which provide relevant Information about the victim machines.

For example, extracting the Native OS Version using the SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX (0x73) command

SMBTouch initiates a session which forces the infected server to disclose OS information. 

Upon finding a vulnerable OS, SMBTouch proceeds to check the permissions it is granted by the OS. SMBTouch then reports what vulnerabilities are present in the system.

This is a familiar procedure in accordance with how exploit kits detect web-browser plugins to analyze vulnerabilities. 

The information provided by SMBTouch is used to serve a suitable exploit.
